You've been using git for years, you really don't need `git status` to tell you things like:

`(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)`
`(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)`
`(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)`
`(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)`

So use this instead which gives you diffstats and local tracking branch information.
